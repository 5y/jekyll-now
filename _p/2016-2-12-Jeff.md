title: When Jeff endorse me for Mozilla Reps.
---
For Mozilla Reps I needed endorsement from someone in Mozilla , and  Jeff Beatty endorsement's was memorable :
>Reza is one of the stars of the Persian l10n community.
I had the pleasure of meeting him via email a few years ago and then meeting him in person at the l10n-driver organized RTL localization hackathon in Sri Lanka last October. Reza has a sincere passion for FOSS and lives in a region of the world where there is a lot of opportunity for FOSS tech evolution. 
He's personable, well spoken, self-motivated,and would be an excellent candidate for becoming Iran's first Mozilla Rep. 
I highly endorse him

Thank you So much Jeff, it's my pleasure too, Always your Attention and support is one of the most motivated things for me and my other friends at Persian l10n community.
