I Love Ramen, I love Nabemono and I love Cheese. but i always curious why we can't find out Cheese in Asian food? 
for some reason for e.g: widespread lactose intolerance and according to the National Institutes of Health,
lactose intolerance is prevalent in most of Asia (that includes China, Japan, Korea, the Pacific Islands, et al).
So we can't find out Cheese in main recipe of Asia food specific Japanese food.

but who said we can't Hack Recipe? 
I try to collected all of theme here soon
